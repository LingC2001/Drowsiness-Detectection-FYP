# Drowsiness Detection Project

Research and development of a drowsiness detection system for drivers using behavioural, physiological and vehicular features.

## Description

Project Objectives:
- Use the selected vehicle/behavioural/physiological sensors to collect data from 20 participants of diverse background in two separate experiments:
- The first experiment will be conducted in a research laboratory where participants’ data will be collected as they operate a virtual driving simulator in three different time periods:
  - Morning sessions: 9-11am
  - Afternoon sessions: 3-5pm
  - Night sessions: 3-5am
- The second experiment will be conducted in a vehicle where the participants’ data will be collected as they are being driven in the passenger seat.
- Process and clean the collected data using conventional noise filtering methods.
- Analyse the data and extract features from the behavioural/physiological data that correlate to drowsiness.
- Determine the relevance of the features by conducting statistical significance tests, and perform feature selection techniques.
- Label the data using participant given KSS values
- Use the discovered features to train a Neural Network classifier that will be able to automatically detect drowsiness by analysing sensor data in real time.
- Implement a software system using a Raspberry Pi and relevant modules or a phone application to alert the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected.
